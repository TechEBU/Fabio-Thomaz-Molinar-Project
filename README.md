## Project:
A Smart contract on the Cardano blockchain that could be used by any person or organization to run FAIR TENDERS which are secure, tamper proof, efficient and that guarantees fairness.

## Suggested Solution:
By “guarantees fairness” it is meant that anyone, including the person or organization running the tender, can’t see the details of the bids sent by other organizations or individuals up until the bidding phase is finalized.
